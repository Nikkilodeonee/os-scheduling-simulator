# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

## Description
This project demonstrates simulations of two CPU scheduling algorithms: FCFS (First Come First Serve) and non-preemptive SJF (Shortest Job First). It creates random processes with varied arrival and burst times, executes scheduling according to each algorithm, and measures average waiting times. The results are visualized with bar charts comparing the waiting time of each process by algorithm.

## Features
- Process generation with random arrival and burst times.
- Accurate FCFS and non-preemptive SJF scheduling implementations.
- Calculation of average waiting times for comparison.
- Detailed visualization of process waiting times with annotated bar charts.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install matplotlib numpy`
3. Run the script `Algorytmy-planowania-czasu-procesora.py`.
4. Observe terminal output for average waiting times and charts for visual comparison.
